Had to import a bunch of data from le foursquare, which would take a while, and I wanted to have a decent idea of how many hits I would get and a man with a beard reminded me that statistics classes were good for something.

You can use this to get a sample size for testing large sets of data:

So given a population of about 500,000 I could get by with only testing 384 elements to find out how many matches I would get over the whole set for foursquare.
